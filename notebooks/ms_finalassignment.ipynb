    "## Project Summary \n",
    "This project analyzes how Sorghastrum nutans, a grass native to North America, is being impacted by climate change. As average temperatures rise, many species are shifting northward in North America to seek cooler temperatures that meet their habitat needs. In this project, I create a habitat suitability model to determine where Sorghastrum nutans is best suited geographically, based on soil, topography, and climate. \n",

    "We use the United States Forest Service (USFS) National Grassland Units, a publically-available database containing shapfiles for the 20 National Grasslands managed by the USFS. For my project, I analyze the Pawnee National Grassland in northeastern Colorado, and the Cimarron National Grassland in southwestern Kansas. These sites are at approximately the same longitude, so we will assess how the higher latutude of the Pawnee grassland may influence the local ecology as compared to the Cimarron grassland further south.
